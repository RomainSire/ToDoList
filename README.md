# To-Do List

Very simple To-Do list using PHP.  
It doesn't uses database, but store tasks in a CSV file. It's not the best option, but I wanted to train to open and edit files with PHP.   
This app was coded during my trainee at the educational establishments [3W Academy](https://3wa.fr/). The code I publish here is my own, before checking the way of coding of this establishment.
